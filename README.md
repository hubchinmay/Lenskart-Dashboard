## 5. Highlights

* Business Problem
The rapidly growing eyewear market, driven by online retailers like Lenskart, presents a vast amount of product data. However, product managers and marketing teams often lack an intuitive way to derive actionable insights from this data. Key questions such as: Which product categories are most popular? What are the pricing trends across different brands? Which frame materials are most in demand? ...are difficult to answer quickly with raw data.

* Goal of the Dashboard
  To deliver an interactive visual tool that:
  * Enables users to explore Lenskart's product catalog comprehensively.
  * Supports decisions related to product assortment, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns.
  * Uncovers trends in product preferences, brand performance, and inventory distribution.
